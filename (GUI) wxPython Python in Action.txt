PART I - INTRODUCTION TO WXPYTHON
Chapter01
Welcome to wxPython

#bare-minimum code to create a wxPython Window
class MyApp(wx.App):
    def OnInit(self):
        self.frame = wx.Frame(None, title = 'Window')
        self.panel = MyFrame(self.frame)
        self.panel.Show()
        return True
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = MyApp(False)
    app.MainLoop()

OnInit() called my application's MainLoop() when the program is stated and provides an entry point to start the main logic
Frame: the main window of your application, top level window
Windows: objects such as buttons or text boxes

The example code illustrates the bare-minimum code
The 5 steps for every wxPython program:
1.) Import the necessary wxPython package
2.) Subclass the wxPython application class
3.) Define an application initialization method
4.) Create an application class instance
5.) Enter the application's main event loop

Step-by-Step of the above 5 steps

1.) Import the necessary wxPython package
import wx #this must be imported first
from wx import xrc #any other wxPython packages,
from wx import html # just to be safe
this order only applies to wxPython modules

2.) Subclass the wxPython application class
every wxPython program must have:
1 application object: instance of wx.App or a subclass you define where you declare OnInit(), OnInit() gets called by wx.App parent class when application starts
at least 1 frame object

3.) Define an application initialization method
if your subclass creates a custom __init__() then the parent method, wx.App.__init__(), is automatically invoked on object creation

4.) Create an application class instance
app = App() #App() is the wx.App subclass
app.MainLoop() #invoked the MainLoop()

Foundation of wxPython Program
1.) application object
2.) top-level window object

Application Object
Manages/starts the main event loop
THe main event loop responds to windowing system events and dispatches them to the right event handler.
Every wxPython application needs exactly 1 application object, must be an instance of class wx.App, or custom class of wx.App
Creating a wx.App subclass
1.) Define the subclass
2.) Write OnInit() method within the subclass. If this returns False exits immediately, so it should return True
3.) Create an instance of the class in the main section of your program
4.) Call the MainLoop() of the application instance. This method transfers program control to wxPython

Top-level window object
Manages the most important data, controls and presents them to the user



Chapter02
Giving your wxPython program a solid foundation

wxPython program foundation, 2 required objects
1.) application object: manages the main event loop, sits on top of the top-level window object
2.) top-level window object: generally manages the most important data and controls and presents them to the user

Application object
there can only be one
the event loop responds to windowing system events and dispatches them to the appropriate event handler, cannot create any wxPython graphical objects until after your program has instantiated an application object

should subclass wx.App for uses, like a database connection
need to perform 2 steps
1.) define the subclass
2.) write an OnInit() method within the subclass definition
3.) create an instance of the class in the main section of your program
4.) call the MainLoop() method of the application instance, this method transfer program control to wxPython

class MyApp(wx.App):
    def OnInit(self):
        # initialization for your custom class is typically managed here, not in the Class __init__()

        # will also call these methods too
        frame = MyFrame('Hello World', (50, 60), (450, 340))
        frame.Show()

if your class needs a __init__() need to call it this way
wx.App.__init__(self)

but will instead use the OnInit()

can call wx.App subclass in main, however it is not recommended to do so

Application object lifecycle
1.) Application object created
    1.) automatically calls OnInit(), window objects can be created
2.) MainLoop() is called, wxPython events are now being handled
    1.) events are now processed
3.) Application object destroyed
    1.) happens when all top-level windows are closed

Top-level window object

Output

Python programs can direct ouput:
1.) standard stream: sys.stdout
2.) standard error stream: sys.stderr

can decide to have wxPython take control of the standard streams and redirect output to a window, this is default on Windows, on Unix more likely to be on a console and therefore wxPython does not control the stream by default

Redirecting output
text sent to streams is redirected to a separate wxPython frame

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # outputs all content into the console
    app = App(redirect=False)

    # write the output to a file
    app = App(redirect=True, filename='output')

Shutting down a wxPython Application
Close() on all top-level windows

to allow the program to continue after the last window closes, SetExitOnFrameDelete(flag=False)

if the program shuts down without your control, you have 1 chance to cleanup resources
your application binds to an event handler for the wx.EVT_QUERY_END_SESSION event, then the event handler is called when wxPython is notified of the shutdown
event parameter is wx.CloseEvent
the close event may allow the application to veto the shutdown, use the CanVeto() to find out
worth doing if you cannot save your resources, if Close() methods return False then the application attempts to veto the shutdown

Top-level window object
the top-level window object is usually the main window of your applcation and contains widgets and interfact objects, any application that doesn't have a parent container
can be:
1.) wx.Frame (the usual case)
2.) wx.Dialog'

Can set it via:
SetTopWindow()
or the first frame in wx.App's top-level window

frame = window

creating subclasses of wx.Frame
wx.Frame(parent, id=-1, title="", pos=wx.DefaultPosition, size=wx.DefaultSize, style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE, name="frame")

hardcoding values for you frame
class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, "My Friendly Window", (100, 100), (100, 100))

wxPython IDs
each widget has a window ID, must be unique within each frame, can resuse IDs between frames
widget_constructor(parent, id_number)
create a unique relationship between an event that happens to a specific object and a function called in response to that event
create an event:
1.) explicitly pass a positive integer into the widget_constructor
2.) get wxPython to create an ID using wx.NewID()
3.) pass either a global constant wx.ID_ANY or -1 to the widget widget_constructor

1.) explicitly pass a positive integer into the widget_constructor
can ensure that wxPython does not use your explicit ID elsewhere by calling wx.RegisterId()

2.) get wxPython to create an ID using wx.NewID()
id = wx.NewId()
frame = wx.Frame.__init__(None, id)

3.) pass either a global constant wx.ID_ANY or -1 to the widget widget_constructor
wx.ID_ANY

frame = wx.Frame.__init__(None, -1)
id = frame.GetID()

Some helpers
point = wx.Point(x_value, y_value)

wx.RealPoint() uses floating-point coordinates

wx.Frame styles
takes a bitmask

SetStyle() allows you to change the styles after the widget was created

| to use multiple styles

the default
wx.MAXIMIZE_BOX | wx.MINIMIZE_BOX | wx.RESIZE_BORDER | wx.SYSTEM_MENU | wx.CAPTION | wx.CLOSE_BOX

disable the user from resizing the window
wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE ^ (wx.RESIZE_BORDER | wx.MINIMIZE_BOX | wx.MAXIMIZE_BOX)

Adding additional widgets
